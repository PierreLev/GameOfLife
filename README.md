# GameOfLife
In this project we had to do an automaton called the Game of Life, or the Conway's game of life. It's a self-construct
circuit based on rules and it's animated. You can change lots of visual parameters with keyboard keys, the speed, and 
even read RLE files in the project. 
As a personal feature and to test our skills in the implementation of sounds and frequencies on C++, we added a function 
when the user pause the game, so there is a small cursor you can see in the top line, that pass on each pixel/cell and make
a sound depending on their positionon the x spectrum.

Here is a good website to see the concept and all the variances of this automaton : http://conwaylife.com/.
